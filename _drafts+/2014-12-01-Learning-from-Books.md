Occasionally, I read books. A few years ago I stopped reading fiction books entirely – besides two or three exceptions a year, when I rock through a fiction books in two nights or so, like "The Circle" – and made non-fiction books my fast food instead. 

Why I call it fast food? Because I'm not reading in a way that I can remember so much of what I read. That's why I'm very grateful for the "clippings" function in my eBook Reader: I can highlight sentences, which then get copied into an extra .txt-file. In the image above, you can see what books I read in the last five months and how many parts I highlighted in each book. And because it can't be that bad to repeat what I found most interesting in all these book, here comes the best clipping of each book:

Anchor Shawn talks in the short book *The Happiness Advantage* about how external factors are only very little important for our wellbeing: *"Our external circumstances predict only about 10 percent of our total happiness."* (p80) – which is always good to remind oneself of. And of course Shawn is advocating for working on the 90%; the own mindset: *"...people can be split into two categories: Those with a “fixed mindset” believe that their capabilities are already set, while those with a “growth mindset” believe that they can enhance their basic qualities through effort."* (p78). But that was nothing new for me. Which really astonished me, however, was the following comment: 

"Common sense is not common action."
=====

Or, differently put, *"Information is not transformation."* (p167) – meaning, *"without action, knowledge is often meaningless* (p150). It makes sense when we look at all the overweight and smoking doctors. But when we really think about it, isn't this incredible? It is so hard to get people to understand information. And then it's hard to make them remember these information. But even if the school / university / newspaper / news show / data graphics accomplishes that, it doesn't necessarily change a thing. Understanding and remembering are necessary for action, but doesn't necessarily induce it.

That's also what Eric Schmidt explained in his book *"How Google Works"*. He has two different solutions for that. First he offers "repeating like hell" as one: *"In most aspects of life, you need to say something about twenty times before it truly starts to sink in. Say it a few times, people are too busy to even notice. By the time you’ve repeated it fifteen to twenty times you may be completely sick of it, but that’s about the time people are starting to get it"* (pos2691). 

But the more creative and less annoying solution might be emotion. Schmidt explains, *"We think that if we have made a clever and thoughtful argument, based on data and smart analysis, then people will change their minds. This isn’t true"* (pos2440). And continues: 

"If you want to change people’s behavior, you need to touch their hearts, not just win the argument."
=====

*"How Google Works"* is one of the rare book where I came across many parts that I didn't agree with. But it also introduced me to some interesting challenges and even more interesting solutions manager can have. For example the challenge of "highest paid person's opinion". And homogeneous opinions in general. Schmidt emphasizes: *"To be a thought leader, you have to have a thought"* (pos2836) and *"If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn’t thinking"* (pos2238). The next book explains why thinking differently makes you more likeable, too:

Christian Rudder doesn't want to induce actions (like Shawn), he just wants to observe them. In his book *Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One’s Looking)*, he explains the preferences and behaviors of users on his dating website okCupid. 
While looking at the ratings of appearance, he notices an interesting fact: People who are widely considered as beautiful, get often 8 or 9 out of 10 stars. But the ones whose appearance polarizes and who get a lot of 0 and 1 stars, also get a lot of 10 stars. He concludes: 

"Even at the person-to-person level, to be universally liked is to be relatively ignored."
==========

He continues: *" To be disliked by some is to be loved all the more by others. And, specifically, a woman’s overall sex appeal is enhanced when some men find her ugly."* So the next time somebody starts a shitstorm on a comment of yours, relax and smile. Your intelligence is enhanced when some people find you stupid...um...

*"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything"* by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner is famous for providing the reader with fun facts à la *"The per-hour death rate of driving versus flying, is about equal"* (pos2398). Nevertheless, some principle gems can be found; especially right in the beginning in the introduction. Here's my favorite:

"Who you are is defined by the values you are willing to struggle for."
==========

Continuing: *"People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who get in good shape. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who move up it."* (pos298) That I chose this quote as my favorite has to do with my high interest of values. It is also a nice reminder that we should embrace who we are and that we should define success individually – instead of listening to society who tells us that "career" is the only way to go when wanting a happy life.
