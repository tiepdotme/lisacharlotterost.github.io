I love drawing my ideas. Using pen and paper is a very big part of my work as a data vis designer. I doodle, I sketch, I make notes. It always comes very natural to me. Intuitively, I grasp for a close-by paper and pen multiple times a day. It’s something I don’t think rationally about. 

That’s what I want to do here: To think about it. Why does drawing thoughts feel so good? I found some reasons, and I’d love to hear yours. This is my love letter for using pen and paper:

<br>
**It structures my thoughts.** Paper is not a passive butler who just saves my thoughts as they are. What paper wants from me is a structured version – a version that CAN be drawn down in the first place. I need to bring my blurry, tangled ideas into shapes and forms that are separate from each other. I need to categorize, label, organize. This process feeds back: It changes my thoughts, which then result in a new drawing.

**It doesn’t distract the creator.** White, unruled paper invites me to endless possibilities. The unlimited potential of the sheet of paper in front of me is magic. Everything is an option. When I’m sketching out a new project, the pen lets me ignore technical difficulties. What separates my blank sheet of paper from ingenuity is not technology, but skills and smarts. I don’t need to open StackOverflow to know how to draw. There is no technological constraint to overcome; no bug to fix; no tutorial to watch to be able to draw with a pen. I don’t get distracted from the tool and the technical problems I have with it. I focus on the thoughts I want to bring to paper. **I ask “What is think-able?” before asking “What is do-able?”**

**It doesn’t distract the viewer.** Everyone knows how to use a pen, so everybody can relate. Nobody asks “How did you do this?” when I show them a drawing, because they know the answer: “Practice, and my imagination.” When someone asks me the same about some code I wrote, the answer is complex: “There is this new library out there, and that lets you do x while still be able to do y, and then I imported it into z where I did this little hack which let’s you…” **Looking with somebody at code ends up in conversations about technology. Looking at drawings ends up in conversations about the content.**

**It gives me an overview.** Boy, I looooove overviews. Overviews are the best. Overviews let me compare, prioritize and decide between elements. To see all my thoughts on one piece of paper at once gives me a map. This map can show me empty spots that still need to be thought about. This map can show me my goal, and it can show me how to get there. 

**It lets me stay high-level.** Designers need to work in two modi: The high-level mode asks: “How do I organize the content?” The low-level mode asks: “How do I make it look good?”. The high-level mode requires common sense, thinking about user experience, storytelling and structuring skills. The low-level mode requires a defined taste for everything visual and insights into how it gets perceived: colors, shapes, images, layout, type. 
Most tools put me immediately in the low-level mode: Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, CSS. Pen and paper is one of the rare tools that forces me to think high-level. I can’t decide for a typeface here; everybody will understand that my hand-writing is a placeholder for that still-to-be-made decision. Everybody will understand that color will be added. Lines will be straightened. Shapes will be resized according to the actual data. And when I say “everybody”, I include myself. **Pen and paper don’t ask: How will elements look like? Pen and paper ask: What elements will be where?**

I often use drawing to lay out blog posts or presentations I will give. **Here are some sketches and links to the final posts:**

*Draft for my talk at Information+: [Less News, More Context](https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/06/16/less-news-more-context/). I draw slides next to each other when I want to think through alternatives for the same slide.*

*Draft for my [How I Feel When I Have A Conversation](https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/08/09/thats-how-I-feel/) post. It was originally just about Facebook. I chose a more general view for the final blog post.*

*Draft for my [How I Feel When I Learn To Code](https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/09/29/learn-how-to-code/)-GIF. I did some more searching sketches beforehand, so this draft is already very similar to the final piece.*

I haven’t read [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/), [Drawing a Hypothesis](http://www.gansterer.org/drawing-a-hypothesis/) or [Infographics Designers' Sketchbooks](https://www.papress.com/html/book.details.page.tpl?isbn=9781616892869) yet, but I probably should. Have a look at them if you’re interested in the topic.
