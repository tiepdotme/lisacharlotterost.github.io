# What I've done with my life so far

I'm a designer & blogger at [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/), a charting tool based in Berlin. I work four days a week,  writing [longer](https://blog.datawrapper.de/category/thoughts-how-to-s/) & [shorter](https://blog.datawrapper.de/category/weekly-chart/) pieces for the [Datawrapper blog](https://blog.datawrapper.de/), making sure people out there know that our app exists, and discussing UI design with my co-workers. Before joining Datawrapper in 2017, I created data visualizations for newsrooms like Bloomberg, Tagesspiegel, SPIEGEL, NPR (as part of a Knight-Mozilla OpenNews Fellowship) and ZEIT Online. In 2014, I graduated with a Master's degree in visual communication after six years of studying in Weimar, Toronto and Oxford.

I care about the data vis community. In 2015, I took over the [Data Vis Meetup Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Visualization-Berlin/events/). These days, my co-host Jonas Parnow and I organize it now and then (rather then than now). Also in 2015, I tried my hands at teaching data vis at several universities in Germany and gave my first "proper" conference talk. In 2018 and as part of my job at Datawrapper, I started organizing the [Data Vis Book Club](https://twitter.com/datavisclub). It's a global & digital book club that focuses on Data Vis books from authors like Cairo, Tufte, Munzner and Cole-Nussbaumer.
