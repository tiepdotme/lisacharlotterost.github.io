It's true! I present to you: A new look. Fresh and not-entirely-ugly (at least in my eyes, but let's see for how long this feeling remains).

"Why a new website?", you ask? Let me explain.

Before today, I had a single-page website with images of my projects, accessible via the address [**lisacharlotterost.de**](http://lisacharlotterost.de/). I built it with plain HTML & CSS a few years back. It looked like this:

On another address – [**lisacharlotterost.github.io**](https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/) – I had hosted a blog with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) since November 2014. It looked like this:

So I had two websites, a portfolio and a blog.

And this wasn't a satisfying situation. Here are the main reasons:

- **I didn't want to confuse people** with two URLs & two looks of two websites.
- The address "lisacharlotterost.github.io" **doesn't look awesome**, anyway.
- I had started writing dozens of blog posts at my new job at [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) and wanted to **integrate these external articles without reposting**. My old blog had a single-page layout, and so I would have needed to create big links...unsatisfying, unsatisfying indeed. I wanted a better solution.
- In general, **my website didn't represent anymore what I do**: lisacharlotterost.de was full of design projects, but not with blog posts. That made sense when my blog was just a hobby and design was what I identified with. But that changed: Writing is what I've been doing most of my time since starting at Datawrapper. It has become my main work. And I wanted to show my work.
- After blogging for a few years, I had written an unskimable number of blog posts. **I wanted to give people a chance to quickly see my "best-of"**. A nice by-product: In the old layout, new articles would have "pushed away" the good stuff. Which made me not want to write new, short, less-good articles. Having a best-of means I don't need to worry about that.
- My blog was built on top of two forked Jekyll themes and I had four giant CSS files and no overview over what they were doing. **I felt like I didn't "own" the code.**

Also, I'm a designer at heart...and we have this notorious thing that we're always unhappy with our portfolio sites and constantly need to redesign them.

So I did.

During the last few (well, eight) months, with big breaks and in tiny sessions, I solved all my issues with the former set-up. I built a Jekyll Github page from scratch, I learned a lot, and now I'm happy.

**Thanks to [Jonathan Muth](https://twitter.com/jonathanmuth)** for his help with building the website – especially the super-custom home-baked cookie warning couldn't have happened without him. (I've never been happier to see a cookie warning.)

<!-- Well, maybe not entirely happy yet: When designing the website, my biggest problem was to find a readable text font for my articles, in the perfect size. But sometimes I opened the local version of my new blog and I thought "huh, that's SMALL, let me make that font bigger"...and then the next time I opened the website, it felt too giant and I set the font size down again. So let me ask you: **Do you think that the font on my blog is too small, too big, or perfectly sized at it is?** Let me know in this Twitter poll: -->


That’s it! If you're interested in learning about the code & want to help me improve it, [find the code on Github](https://github.com/lisacharlotterost/lisacharlotterost.github.io). I'll be very, very grateful. And like always, you'll find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lisacrost) or via email: [lisacharlotterost@gmail.com](mailto:lisacharlotterost@gmail.com).
